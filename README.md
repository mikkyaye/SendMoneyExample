# SendMoneyExample
This repository contains a basic solidity contract that allows deposits of money and withdraw of money, you can also check your balance.

we run through a basic solidity app that receives money and withdraws funds too with a balance checker, we learn about the msg.value property, we work with the .balance function and we work with the msg.sender property.

we start with the msg.value this is a uint value that shows a uint value of the address being used. then we have the balance function which get the a balance from an address using the address() function which pulls the address from the linked account when expressing it like this "address(this).balance. next and last we have the msg.sender valuse which holds the message senders address.
